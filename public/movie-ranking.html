<h3>Der Goldene Handschuh</h3>
<p>

    Honka. Movie contains really shocking scenes and one
    of the best actings I ever seen.
</p>

<h3>Titane</h3>
<p>
    One of the best movies I've ever seen. The actors are all
    awesome, and the story is really beautiful. It starts with
    shocking violence scenes then turn into a really touching
    drama movie.
</p>

<h3>Die Summe Meiner Einzelnen Teile</h3>
<p>
    An movie about an man with schizophrenia that makes an strange
    friendship with an boy. Its a sad movie, but the best thing 
    about it is Peter Schneider being handsome with beard.
